## Contributing as a Developer
- When creating a bug report: Please follow the template and provide detailed information.
- When fixing a feature: Create a Pull Request (PR) with accompanying test code.
- When adding a feature: First, propose the feature in an Issue.

If you provide the design intentions and test code, I will generally accept the Pull Request.


## Contributing Outside of Coding
