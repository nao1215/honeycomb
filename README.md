Honeycomb is an application that uses the Nostr Protocol to post messages and view trends from the terminal. It is designed to offer both a Command Line Interface and a Text User Interface.

My main purposes for developing Honeycomb are the following:

- To create a comfortable social network as an alternative to X (formerly Twitter) and BlueSky.
- To serve as a testing ground for trying out new technologies.

I enjoy having a free environment and working in the terminal. Therefore, I intend to develop a user-friendly CLI.

## How to install
**go install**
```shell
go install github.com/nao1215/honeycomb@latest
```

**homebrew**
```shell
brew install nao1215/tap/honeycomb
```

## Supported platforms and requirements
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows
- go 1.21 or later

## How to use

### Log in with an existing account
Honeycomb checks for the presence of a private key (e.g. nsec**) available at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/.config/honeycomb/private_key`. If no private key is found, honeycomb will prompt you to enter your private key.   

Honeycomb validates the private key and stores the correct private key locally. 
The feature to create a new account using Honeycomb is not yet implemented. However, we plan to offer this functionality in the future.

### View timeline, follow users, and more
Once you have logged in, you can view your timeline, follow users, and more. Now, we have several tabs that are not yet implemented.

### Post a message
You can post a message by pressing the `p` key. The message will be displayed in the timeline of the users who follow you.
