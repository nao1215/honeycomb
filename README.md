Honeycomb is an application that uses the Nostr Protocol to post messages and view trends from the terminal. It is designed to offer both a Command Line Interface and a Text User Interface.

My main purposes for developing Honeycomb are the following:

To create a comfortable social network as an alternative to X (formerly Twitter) and BlueSky.
To serve as a testing ground for trying out new technologies.
I enjoy having a free environment and working in the terminal. Therefore, I intend to develop a user-friendly CLI.

## How to install
**go install**
```shell
go install github.com/nao1215/honeycomb@latest
```

**homebrew**
```shell
brew install nao1215/tap/honeycomb
```

## Supported platforms and requirements
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows
- go 1.20 or later

## How to use
Work in progress.
